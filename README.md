# Poll-Prediction
During each election year, we are inundated with the results of political preference polls. The media presents the results of these polls with little or no discussion of their accuracy. TV news reports typically present a set of poll percentages as if they were the actual population percentages, while newspapers may include a small-font footnote stating that the results have an error of (3-5)%. Such statements are based on the conservative bound on the s.d. of a sample proportion and ignore several issues that can impact the results significantly. This project is intended to examine some of those issues. Note that the percentages for each candidate are not independent, and so confidence intervals for each percentage would not be independent. Suppose that the poll asks respondents how likely they are to vote and then labels each respondent as either likely to vote or not likely to vote. The final poll report is based only on those who are labeled as likely to vote. There are two types of populations to be examined. The first scenario is the preferences of those who claim they will vote but don't vote and those who vote are the same. Another one is the preferences of those who claim they will vote but don't vote and those who vote are not the same.
